# UnPhysics-Engine v0.0.3

extremely rudimentary physics engine written in the D-Language meant for simple particle calculation with decent approximentity.
currently, the main goal of this is to create a decently functional Particle Simulator -- complete with Quantum idea's as well as general Classical Mechanics.

## Getting Started

Running this program, because it's terminal-based, is extremely simple.

Very simpily, download the zip, or clone the reposity, then, unzip if necessary, then compile the code.
Once compiled, run the program: or simply, run the program with the compilation.

### Prerequisites

Requirements for the software and other tools to build, test and push 
- DMD, GDC, or LDC
- Makefile (soon)

### Installing

Installing is extremely simple, just use this command:

Say what the step will be

    git clone https://github.com/Komanturne/UnPhysics-Engine

And then...

    rdmd physics.d settings.d

(this can also be done with other compilers.)

## Built With

  - [D-Language](https://dlang.org/) - Programming Language
  - [UnLicense](https://creativecommons.org/) - License

  - (note, some programming was done with the help of AI; this is not all code, however, some debugging of errors is done with AI if I myself cannot find the error.)
